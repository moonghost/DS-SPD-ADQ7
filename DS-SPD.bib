abstract = {InGaAs/InP single-photon detectors (SPDs) are the key devices for applications requiring near-infrared single-photon detection. The gating mode is an effective approach to synchronous single-photon detection. Increasing gating frequency and reducing the module size are important challenges for the design of such a detector system. Here we present for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, an InGaAs/InP SPD with 1.25\&\#x00A0;GHz sine wave gating (SWG) using a monolithically integrated readout circuit (MIRC). The MIRC has a size of 15\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;mm\&\#x00D7;15\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;mm and implements the miniaturization of avalanche extraction for high-frequency SWG. In the MIRC, low-pass filters and a low-noise radio frequency amplifier are integrated based on the technique of low temperature co-fired ceramic, which can effectively reduce the parasitic capacitance and extract weak avalanche signals. We then characterize the InGaAs/InP SPD to verify the functionality and reliability of the MIRC, and the SPD exhibits excellent performance with 27.5\% photon detection efficiency, a 1.2\&\#x00A0;kcps dark count rate, and 9.1\% afterpulse probability at 223\&\#x00A0;K and 100\&\#x00A0;ns hold-off time. With this MIRC, one can further design miniaturized high-frequency SPD modules that are highly required for practical applications.},

abstract="The rapid development of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors over the past decade has led to numerous advances in quantum information technology. The record for the best system detection efficiency at an incident photon wavelength of 1550 nm is 93{\%}. This performance was attained from a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector made of amorphous WSi; such detectors are usually operated at sub-Kelvin temperatures. In this study, we first demonstrate superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors made of polycrystalline NbN with system detection efficiency of 90.2{\%} for 1550-nm-wavelength photons at 2.1 K, accessible with a compact cryocooler. The system detection efficiency saturated at 92.1{\%} when the temperature was lowered to 1.8 K. We expect the results lighten the practical and high performance superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to quantum information and other high-end applications.",

abstract = {We demonstrated a laser depth imaging system based on the time-correlated single-photon counting technique, which was incorporated with a low-jitter superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD), operated at the wavelength of 1550 nm. A sub-picosecond time-bin width was chosen for photon counting, resulting in a discrete noise of less than one/two counts for each time bin under indoor/outdoor daylight conditions, with a collection time of 50 ms. Because of the low-jitter SNSPD, the target signal histogram was significantly distinguishable, even for a fairly low retro-reflected photon flux. The depth information was determined directly by the highest bin counts, instead of using any data fitting combined with complex algorithms. Millimeter resolution depth imaging of a low-signature object was obtained, and more accurate data than that produced by the traditional Gaussian fitting method was generated. Combined with the intensity of the return photons, three-dimensional reconstruction overlaid with reflectivity data was realized.},

For the first time to our knowledge, the photon-counting time-of-flight technique was demonstrated at a wavelength of 1550 nm using a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector. The performance achieved suggests that a system using superconducting detectors has the potential for low-light-level and eye-safe operation. The system's instrumental response was 70 ps full width at half-maximum, which meant that 1 cm surface-to-surface resolution could be achieved by locating the centroids of each return signal. A depth resolution of 4 mm was achieved by employing an optimized signal-processing algorithm based on a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method.},

  abstract={Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) eliminates all loopholes on detection. Previous experiments of time-bin phase-encoding MDI-QKD allow a factor of 3/4 loss in the final key for the incapability of identifying two successive detection events by a single photon detector. Here we propose a new scheme to realize the time-bin phase-encoding MDI-QKD. The polarization states are used to generate the time bins and the phase-encoding states. The factor of loss in the final key is eliminated by using four single photon detectors at the measurement site. We show the feasibility of our scheme with a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration. The phase reference frame is rotated extremely slowly with only passive stabilization measures. The quantum bit error rate can reach 0.8% in the Z-basis and 26.2% in the X-basis.}

The detection efficiency and after-pulse probability of an InGaAs/InP SPAD are investigated with a 10 MHz gating for conventional and proposed methods, and a sharp decrease of after-pulse probability is demonstrated with the application of the proposed method.
